# How to contribute

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved!

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issues tracker for:

* [bug reports](#bug-reports)
* [feature requests](#feature-requests)
* [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests)

## Bug reports

A bug is either a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused in Lunar failing to provide the expected feature or indicate missing, unclear, or misleading documentation. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the `main` branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate and report the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test case.

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

Now, you can copy/paste this file in the issue on github and fill the gaps. You can let the lines started by `<!--` they will not be displayed by github.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome and should be discussed on issue tracker. But take a moment to find
out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you*
to make a strong case to convince the community of the merits of this feature.
Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

The `dev` branch is the main and only branch which should be used for all pull requests.

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree that your work will be
licensed under the license used by the project.

If you have any large pull request in mind (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, etc), **please ask first** otherwise you risk spending
a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might
not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions in the project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.). Use `cargo fmt` if you want to make things easier.

Thank you.
