Work in progress, point & click pirate trading web browser game (through WASM).

Live demo at: https://modotte.github.io/lunar

## Usage
> Note: This project outputs a Webassembly file. So make sure your browser is [WASM compatible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly#browser_compatibility).

Currently you'll need Rust tools and `trunk` installed with `cargo install trunk`.
Once you have it installed, just run `trunk serve` in the project directory and go http://localhost:8080 with your web browser to see the application.
